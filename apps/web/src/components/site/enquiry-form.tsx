 * before the record exists is how an enquiry gets missed, and for years this

 *

 * the office answers, and turns into a booking once the journey is agreed:
 *
 *   "short"  the homepage and contact bands — who you are and roughly what
 *   "full"   the request page: the whole journey in one pass (PRD §10.1)
 *
 * The date is optional in both. Somebody who has not settled on one is
 * precisely who the request page is also for, and "sometime in June" is an
 * answerable enquiry; agreeing a date is what the office does next.
