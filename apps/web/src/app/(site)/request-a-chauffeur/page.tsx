 * The one way in.
 *
 * There were two pages here: a quote request and a booking request. A visitor
 * standing in front of them had to work out which of the two they were doing
 * before they could ask us anything, and the honest answer was that both did
 * the same thing — asked us, and waited for a person to reply. The difference
 * was ours, not theirs, so it has gone back to being ours: everything sent
 * here is an enquiry, and the office turns one into a booking once it is
 * agreed.
 *
 * Nothing here confirms a journey. The date is a date somebody would like,
 * not one they have been given, and the copy has to keep saying so — a page
 * that reads like a checkout will be treated as one.
