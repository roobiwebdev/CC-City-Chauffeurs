 * without a deploy.
 *
 * Reads are cached for a minute and tagged, which keeps a busy page to one
 * request while still turning an editor's change around quickly. The bands
 * arrive with their references already resolved — a featured-fleet band
 * carries its vehicles — so no page has to make a second call to draw a

 * That distinction matters more than it looks. These pages are generated
 * ahead of time, so an error swallowed here does not degrade a page — it
 * bakes a 404 into it and serves that as the website until something
 * rebuilds it. Throwing instead gives the two behaviours actually wanted:
 * a build against an unreachable API fails, leaving the previous deployment
 * serving; and a failed revalidation of a live page keeps the last good copy
 * rather than replacing it with a 404.
 *
 * Wrapped in `cache` because the timeout's signal opts the request out of
 * Next's own per-render memoisation — without it the layout and the page
 * would each fetch the settings they share.
