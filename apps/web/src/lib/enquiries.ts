 * Sending an enquiry from the website.

 * Everything a visitor sends is an enquiry, and it is recorded against the

 * request that exists only in a chat window is one that can be missed, and the
 * admin's pipeline is built on having the record. The office turns an enquiry
 * into a booking once the journey is agreed.
 *
 * Nothing here is fire-and-forget. A visitor who has just written out a
 * wedding itinerary is owed the truth about whether we have it, so every
 * answer the API can give comes back as something the form can act on: a 422
 * belongs beside the field that caused it, a 429 is worth waiting out, and an
 * unreachable API is worth pressing again. A failure the caller cannot see is
 * a failure nobody ever fixes.
