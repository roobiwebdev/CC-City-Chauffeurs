/**
 * One-off source optimisation for the site's photography.
 *
 * The client's originals are full-resolution camera files. Next's image
 * optimiser resizes on delivery, so visitors were never served these bytes —
 * but they are slow to build, expensive to cache-warm, and there is no reason
 * to keep a 4000px master in the repository when nothing renders above 2400.
 *
 * This rewrites each JPEG in place at a sane ceiling. Originals are recoverable
 * from git (`git checkout -- apps/web/public/gallery apps/web/public/media`) — the
 * files are committed and were untouched when this was first run.
 *
 *   pnpm --filter web optimise:photos          # rewrite
 *   pnpm --filter web optimise:photos --dry    # report only
