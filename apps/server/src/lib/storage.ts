/**
 * Where a photograph lives: a Cloudflare R2 bucket, read by the public
 * through the bucket's public address.
 *
 * The caller hands over a file and gets back an address, a key, dimensions
 * and a size. The database keeps the address, which is what the website and
 * the admin render, and the key, which is what lets the file be replaced or
 * removed from the bucket when its record is.
 *
 * A key is never written twice. An upload gets a fresh name every time, so a
 * page that is already pointing at a photograph never finds it changed
 * underneath, and the address can be cached forever. Replacing a photograph
 * is a new key and a rewrite of every record that referred to the old one.
 *
 * The bucket may be shared with other projects, so everything this site
 * stores sits under one prefix, and nothing outside it is ever listed,
 * written or deleted.
